defmodule Packmatic.Field.Shared.ExtendedInformation do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents the Zip64 Extended Information Extra Field, which can be emitted in both Local and
  Central File Headers, but in practice only used in the Central File Header within Packmatic, due
  to its streaming nature.

  Furthermore, disregarding the APPNOTEâ€™s indication that the field should only be used if the
  sizes are set to `0xFF 0xFF` / `0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF`, since Packmatic _always_ skips the file
  sizes in the Local File Header (due to the archive being generated in a streaming fashionn), and
  _always_ emits the sizes in the Central Directory File Header as `0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF` for
  simplicity, the Zip64 Extended Information Extra Field is _never_ emitted by Packmatic in the
  Local File Header, and _always_ emitted by Packmatic in the Central Directory File Header, with
  both Uncompressed and Compressed Sizes.
