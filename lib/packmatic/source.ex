defmodule Packmatic.Source do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines how data can be acquired in a piecemeal fashion, perhaps by reading only a few pages
  from the disk at a time or only a few MBs of data from an open socket.

  The Source behaviour defines two functions, `init/1` and `read/1`, that must be implemented by
  conforming modules. The first function initialises the Source and the second one iterates it,
  reading more data until there is no more.

  ## Representing Sources

  Sources are represented in Manifest Entries as tuples such as `{:file, path}` or `{:url, url}`.
  This form of representation is called a Source Entry; the first element in the tuple is the name
  and the second element is called the Initialisation Argument (`init_arg`).

  The Source Entry is a stable locator of the underlying data which has no runtime implications.
  The Encoder hydrates the Source Entry into whatever the Source module implements internally,
  when it is time to pull data from that source.

  The Initialisation Argument is usually a basic Elixir type, but in the case of Dynamic Sources,
  it is a function which resolves to a Source Entry understood by either the File or URL source.
